I am an incoming Data Scientist in the Department of Biostatistics & Health Informatics at Kingâ€™s College London. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. from KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Dongman Lee. 
My research lies at the intersection of multimodal ubiquitous computing, human activity recognition, and machine learning, with a particular focus on self-learning activity recognition and personalization in open-world settings. 
I aim to develop methods that are robust in the wild and actionable in real healthcare contexts. 

I am seeking motivated collaborators in healthcare and AI.
